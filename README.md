## 🧮 Financial Planning Application by Jacob Parker

### 🔍 Overview

The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly **financial planning application** where users can store and retrieve non-sensitive financial data. The application allows users to input a variety of financial details—including **transactions**, **investments**, and **debts**—which are securely stored in a **MySQL** database. This data is then presented back to users in multiple formats, helping them assess their current financial standing with clarity and ease.
